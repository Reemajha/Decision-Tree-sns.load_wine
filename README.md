Implementing Decision Tree

Dataset Used - Internal Data (load_wine)

Understandind Data: 
Data is Classification and has three outputs (0,1,2) in the Dependent Variable (Wine)

It was a Clean Data. 
1st Step: Seperate Independent and Dependent Variable 
2nd Step: Perform Train Test Split 
3rd Step: Build the Model (Decision Tree)

Accuracy: 94%

Finally, plotted the tree for better visualization.
